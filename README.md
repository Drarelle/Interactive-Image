}
```

Edit your javascript file

```javascript
var items = [
    {
        title: "Fur",
        description: "The fur of clouded leopards is of a dark grey or ochreous ground-colour, often largely obliterated by black and dark dusky-grey blotched pattern.",

        }
    },
    {
        title: "Canines",

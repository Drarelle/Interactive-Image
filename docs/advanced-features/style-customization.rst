Style customization
-------------------

| You may want to change the rendering of an item, as for example the
  background and the front color of text items.
| Adapt this CSS snippet to your needs and add it after the
  ``interactive-image`` css file is loaded:

.. code:: css

   .interactive-image .text-item {
     background-color: blue;
     color: yellow;
   }
